## Deploying Python Azure Function App for Chatbot
To deploy the code into a function app in azure, first update your code to the code mentioned in the"__init__.py " file for online use then follow the steps mentioned in the file "Steps to deploy python azure function app for chatbot"

## Prerequisites for RAG deployment

1.Create Azure Resources: Azure Cognitive Search Service â€“ to index and search documents.And an Azure Storage Account â€“ to store your documents.
                         
2.Upload Documents:In your Storage Account, create a Blob Container. Upload all the documents you want the chatbot to use for retrieval.
                   
3.Configure AI Models:In your Azure AI Foundry (previously created), add a Text Embedding Model to GPT-4o.This embedding model will be used for semantic search in your RAG pipeline.
                      
4.Create an Index in Azure Search:Use the embedding model to create a search index. this index will enable the chatbot to retrieve relevant document chunks.
